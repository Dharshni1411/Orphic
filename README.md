"The Orphic app🤖 is a skin tone and body shape analyzer that uses image analysis and user input to determine skin tone and body shape classifications. Users can upload images of themselves, and the app employs computer vision techniques to analyze the uploaded image, determining whether the skin tone is categorized as fair, dusky, or dark. This classification is based on color range thresholds in LAB color space and calculates the percentage of each skin tone in the image.📸

Moreover, the app also facilitates body shape analysis by collecting user input regarding measurements like bust, waist, hips, and gender. Based on these inputs, it computes ratios between body measurements to classify body shapes such as hourglass, pear, rectangle, etc.

The app's analysis generates personalized suggestions for users based on their detected skin tone, body shape, and gender💻. These suggestions include descriptive information and images representing fashion or style recommendations tailored to the user's specific skin tone and body shape classification.

Implemented using Flask, a Python web framework, this application comprises multiple routes for different functionalities such as skin tone analysis, body shape analysis, and suggestion generation. Additionally, it allows users to navigate through various HTML templates for different aspects of the analysis and suggestions.

This Orphic app aims to provide users with tailored fashion suggestions and insights, empowering them to make informed choices about clothing styles and accessories that complement their unique skin tone and body shape characteristics."🔍
